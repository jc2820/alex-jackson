# Alex Jackson artist's portfolio page

This repo is for developing a website commission for an artists webpage.

View the current version via the link from this repo.

Current user stories include include: 
* I want to be able to see the artworks as full page images.
* I want to be able to switch between images with a simple navbar.
* I want to be able to see basic contact information for the artist.

At present this project is on hold until Alex and I have time to discuss it together.
